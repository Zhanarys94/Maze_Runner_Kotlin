# Maze_Runner_Kotlin
Study project for Hyperskill Kotlin Core path

Learn to use Random class with lists and multidimensional arrays and store the results in a file.
Mazes are amazing: keep running, find the exit if you can! If you are not too happy about getting stuck in the actual maze, you can entertain yourself with a virtual one.
In this project, you will write a program that generates mazes and looks for a way out.
